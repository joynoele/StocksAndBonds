# StocksAndBonds
Base simulation for the 1964 3M bookshelf game, Stocks &amp; Bonds. [https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1590/stocks-bonds]

Long term goals
- Simulate the base game "Stocks & Bonds" modeled on the referenced board game
- Employ highest quality architecture, design, and craft to the solution (all the things we don't have time for IRL jobs but wish we did)
- Develope hooks to develop and pit AI's against each other to determine best strategy
- Keep solution flexiable enough to add complexity tweaks to the game structure

Open to PRs from friends and well-meaning devs.
